# Japanese-from-Scratch
iOS App project, written with SwiftUI framework. Needs *LOTS* of improvements and rebuild with UIKit.

The main purpose of Japanese App is to be a helpful and easy to use *reference book*. 
People that learn Japanese will have grammar, placed by categories (N5, N4, N3, N2 and N1)

Right now I'm using **SwiftUI** and it has a lot of bugs, so I'm waiting for the new version in September (don't like using Betas) or
the best idea would be rebuilding it using **Storyboard and UIKit**.

Okay so here is the list of problems(?):
- Grammar requires *TONS OF WORK*: 
  - formating every lesson by levels of **JLPT** and placing it in JSON document
  - since I haven't worked on this project for a long time, even a JSON file has a lot of mistakes (cringe)
- Design also needs to be changed:
  - from changing the size of the text to animations
  
 As you can understand, right now i'm not working on this project, so it would be better rebuilding it and creating a new repository, but with Stroyboard and with corrected mistakes.
